My research interests broadly focus on the mathematical and theoretical interpretation of technology and economics, utilizing methodologies such as optimization, stochastic and dynamic methods, game theory, mean-field approach, and so on to address real-world operational problems. 
In particular, I am interested in the interplay of the mathematical structures (like convexity, submodularity, sparsity, and low-rank property); behavioral analysis (such as cooperation and competition) raised in the dynamic game and control theory; Probability approach as a foundational method, like stochastic modelling method.

I am a Yr-1 Master's student in computational and applied math at UChicago. Previously, I earned my bachelor degree in pure mathematics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was an exchange student to Columbia University at the spring semester in my junior year.
