My research interests are on the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of a wide range problems with **computational mathematics** background. Previous, I have conducted projects related to convex, non-convex and combinatorial optimziation, inverse problems. I am working on a project related to game theory, convex optimizaion, dynamic programming now advised by [Dr. A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang).

## Publication

Haoyu Wu, Ao Tang, "[An Even Tighter Bound for the Shapley-Folkman-Starr Theorem](https://haoyuwu02.github.io/files/SFS.pdf)", Journal of Mathematical Economics, Volume 114, 2024. [doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2024.103028](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2024.103028).

## Working Paper

I'm working on a paper about voting problem incorprating dynamic game. The working manuscript is [here](https://haoyuwu02.github.io/files/Voting.pdf).
