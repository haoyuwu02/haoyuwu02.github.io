I am a Yr-1 Master student in computational and applied math at UChicago. Previously, I earned my bachelor degree in mathematics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology at 2024. 

My research interests are mathematical and theoretical interpretation of technology or economy, which offers qualitative improvements in many industrial problems and extensively promotes social efficiency. 

## Research

I am working on a paper related to game theory, convex optimizaion, dynamic programming advised by [Dr. A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang). Previously, I have conducted projects related to combinatorial assignment problem, optimziation and inverse problems. Go to the "projects" page to find details!

## Publication

Haoyu Wu, Ao Tang, "[An Even Tighter Bound for the Shapley-Folkman-Starr Theorem](https://haoyuwu02.github.io/files/SFS.pdf)", Journal of Mathematical Economics, V114, 2024. [doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2024.103028](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2024.103028).

## Working Paper

I'm working on a paper about voting problem incorprating dynamic game. The working manuscript is [here](https://haoyuwu02.github.io/files/dynamicvoting.pdf).

## Graduate Coursework

**HKUST**: Applied Analysis, Advanced Probability;

**Columbia**: Convex Optimization, Combinatorial Optimization;

**UChicago**: Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus, Probability and Statistic, Matrix Computation.

## Coding

I implement the algorithms/regressions in my ML course and the simulation of Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman equation, both in **Python**.  

## Teaching Assiant

* I was a UG TA grading the homework of Honor Calculus I course in HKUST, 2023 fall;
* I was a TA in Math Support Center in HKUST, 2022 fall.

## Service and leadership

* Executive Member of Chinese Folk Art Society HKUSTSU, 2022;
* China Social Media Team, UG Recruitment and Admission Office, HKUST, since 2020;
* Head Student Ambassador, UG Recruitment and Admission Office, HKUST, since 2020;
* Student Representative of Math Student Liaison Subcommittee Meeting for 3 semester.
