My research interests broadly focus on the mathematical and theoretical interpretation of technology and economics, utilizing methodologies such as optimization, stochastic and dynamic methods, game theory, mean-field approach, and so on to address real-world operational problems. 

I am a year 1 Ph.D. student at Chicago Booth school of business. Previously, I earned my bachelor degree in mathematics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST) and master degree in applied math from Univerisity of Chicago. I was an exchange student to Columbia University at the spring semester in my junior year.
