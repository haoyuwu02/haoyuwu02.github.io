Here is my work in summer of 2023 in Ithaca, N.Y., and the paper is published now!

Our work focused on applying the refined lemma to improve the estimation of the Hausdorff distance between the Minkowski sum and its convex hull, categorizing the convexity. Our result offers qualitative improvement in specific cases and makes application to the course allocation problem, a typical combinatorial assignment problem.

The main idea of our work, instead of the traditional method of separately estimating each component of the Minkowski sum, considers all components jointly and uses the constraint on convexity from the refined lemma to reach a tighter bound.
