It's well known that the Median Voter Theorem states that candidates will try to move to the center in an election to maximize their benefits. However, this rule does not hold true in high-dimensional spaces. Existing results indicate that the existence of equilibria in high dimensions is guaranteed by conservative symmetric conditions. We aim to explore the Median Voter Theorem in high dimensions. Additionally, we will incorporate dynamic programming (specifically, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation) into the voting problem to study candidates' behavior under certain utility models and voter distributions.

I am working on the paper and feel free to email me for the manuscript or sharing any idea!
